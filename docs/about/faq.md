* Coming soon: You can try out any of the protocols through their corresponding web applications at [app.nibiru.fi](https://app.nibiru.fi).

## ❓ — NIBI FAQ

### What is NIBI token used for?

The security of the Nibiru blockchain relies on a set of validators to commit new blocks and participate in Tendermint BFT consensus by broadcasting votes that contain cryptographic signatures signed by each validator's private key. Validators stake **NIBI**, the protocol's native token used for gas, governance, and "mining". Users can delegate NIBI to validators that record and verify transactions in exchange for rewards.

### Where can I buy NIBI and NUSD?

You simply need to have a [Keplr wallet](https://www.keplr.app/) to purchase NIBI and NUSD. This will also enable you to move assets between IBC-enabled blockchains. NIBI and NUSD can be purchased from liquidity pools on Nibi-Swap. You can also mint NUSD directly with USDC.

### How is the NUSD supply created?

Users mint NUSD by placing NIBI and any accepted form of collateral (such as USDC) into the system. In return, the protocol mints and gives an equivalent value in NUSD back to the user minus a small transaction fee. Similarly, an NUSD holder can **burn NUSD** in exchange for equivalent value of NIBI and collateral. This process is described in detail on the [Nibiru Stablecoin - NUSD](../content/stablecoin.md) page.

### What is the release schedule of NIBI?

The token release schedule is described in the [Tokenomics page](../content/tokenomics.md).

### Where can I go to get other questions answered?
