# ðŸ’¹ Tokenomics


Nibiru will have a fully diluted token supply of 1.5B tokens. The tokens will be distributed among the following groups:

| Split (%) | Group                   | Description                                                                 | Schedule                                                    |
| --------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 60        | Community               | Stakers, perps traders, and liquidity providers of the AMM | Non-linear schedule similar to Juno or Curve.               |
| 21        | Team                    | Core team and future hires                                                  | 1 year cliff, then 3 year linear vest                       |
| 8.5       | Seed                    | Seed investors                                                              | 1 year cliff, then 3 year linear vest                       |
| 10.5      | Private                 | Strategic partners and private investors                                    | 1 year cliff, then 3 year linear vest (liquid each quarter) |

The token supply is distributed over an 8-year time frame with the following release schedule.

As more tokens are released into the ecosystem, Nibiru will be governed primarily by the community.

## Team (21%)

The Nibiru Chain development tteam will receive 21% of the total token allocation. A quart of this allocation will be realized after a 12-month cliff, and the rest will vest linearly over 36 months post-cliff.

## Seed Investors (8.5%)

Seed investors who contributed funds to the initial development and launch of Nibiru will receive an allocation of 8.5% from the total distribution. A quart of this allocation will be realized after a 12-month cliff, and the rest will vest linearly over 36 months post-cliff. 

## Private (10.5%)

Investors and strategic partners will receive an allocation of 10.5% from the total distribution. A quart of this allocation will be realized after a 12-month cliff, and the rest will vest linearly over 36 months post-cliff.

All of the private investorsâ€™ (including seed) token allocation can be staked during the lock, which would result in liquid rewards to be used discretionarily.

This gives investors the ability to either provide liquidity to the AMM or increase the staked amount.

## Community (60%)

### Stakers

Stakers (validators and delegators) will receive token allocation over 8 years. After that, stakers will receive a portion of the platform revenue.

### Treasury

The treasury is constructed as a discretionary fund to ensure the stability of the protocol. The treasury will initially be managed by a multi-sig wallet held by members of the core team, and will eventually transition to being controlled by the community.

### Community: Nibi-Swap AMM

Nibi-Swap AMM liquidity providers will receive inflationary incentives for locking their LP shares with liquidity gauges.

Liquidity providers can choose to lock their LP tokens in a gauge on a continuous time curve between for up to 4 years. Locking liquidity for longer gives higher incentive rewards, which are realized in-full at the end of the lock period.

### Community: Perps Exchange

Traders will be rewarded with NIBI tokens for doing certain actions on the perps trading platform, such as opening positions or paying funding payments.

<!-- 
Nibiruâ€™s Perp Exchange will also incentivize the safety staking pool (see [dYdXâ€™s Safety Module](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/staking-pools/safety-staking-pool)) with NIBI as an additional backstop for the system.
